                    StreamStats is a Web application that provides access to an assortment of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analytical tools that are useful for water-resources planning and management, and for 
                    engineering and design purposes. The map-based user interface can be used to delineate drainage areas for user-selected sites on streams, and then get basin characteristics and estimates of flow 
                    statistics for the selected sites anywhere this functionality is available. StreamStats users also can select the locations of U.S. Geological Survey data-collection stations, shown as triangles 
                    on the StreamStats map, and get flow statistics and other information for the stations. The types of flow statistics that are available vary from state to state. A variety of additional tools are 
                    available for discovering information about streams and the activities along them. <br><br>

                    StreamStats works within Web browser software on personal computers and mobile devices, and is best viewed using the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Chrome, or Firefox. The 
                    browser must allow HTML5 asynchronous script execution. The application is being continually improved and expanded. The News link in our left-hand menu will provide notices of any new enhancements. <br>

                    The <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/streamstats">StreamStats home page</a> provides links to a more detailed description of the program, a user's manual, descriptions of the outputs, definitions of basin 
                    characteristics and streamflow statistics, limitations for use of the application, and other information. The user's manual also can be accessed by clicking on the Help link on the user interface. Users 
                    should read the user's manual before attempting to use the application. <br><br>

                    The map above indicates the status of StreamStats nationally. Green states are available with full functionality. Purple states allow basin delineations and computing basin characteristics, but estimates 
                    of flow statistics from regression equations are not available. Blue states are currently in development. Orange states are not implemented because no other agency has agreed to partner with the USGS to 
                    cover implementation costs. <br><br>

                    The U.S. Geological Survey StreamStats interface was developed in cooperation with many agency (federal, state, and local) partners by the Web Informatics and Mapping (WiM) group in collaboration with 
                    the USGS Office of Surface Water StreamStats team, working with USGS Water Science Centers across the nation. USGS thanks the cooperators and collaborators that have helped to make full or partial implementation 
                    of StreamStats possible within their states and regions.
